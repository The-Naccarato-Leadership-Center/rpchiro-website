			&quot;I spent close to $100,000 with various practice management organizations before I found Dr. Naccarato.
			I knew a successful practice had more to do with honesty and integrity than patient pressure, memorized scripts, or a multitude of other
			gimmicks. I wish I would have met him a lot sooner.&quot;

      You are a doctor, that is your genius and that is what you are trained to do. Moreover, you are a provider therefore you must make enough money to live a great lifestyle, get out of debt and prepare for retirement. To achieve these objectives you, like all successful people, must accept that you cannot do it all. You must look to a coach for input, evaluate his recommendations, and have the humility to act on what applies to your situation. Choosing the right coach is a big decision. He and his program must be credible, practical, and personal:

<ol>
<li><b>Credible:</b> The coach you work with must be trustworthy and possess the expertise needed to help you succeed and prosper. With a Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology, a Doctor of Chiropractic Degree, and a PhD in Psychology, I have coached chiropractic doctors for twenty two years, have 43,000 hours of one on one coaching experience and personally build seventy two practices per week. </li>
<br><li><b>Practical:</b> This program you choose cannot be based on theoretical ideals. It cannot include speculation, hype, or quick fix gimmicks. Everything in this program is straight forward and matches the dignity of a doctor. All procedures are taught in a practical, easy to follow, step by step format that has been proven to work. </li> 
<br><li><b>Personal:</b> Contrary to popular ideology there is no such thing as “one approach fits all”. The only success strategy we can prove that <i>really</i> works to bring you lasting success and prosperity is the approach we <i>customize</i> to fit you. This program will honor, focus, and capitalize on your uniqueness. </li>
</ol>
Many of us assume that to prosper, excellence in our field is all we need.  Not true. If it were we would not have so many outstanding practitioners who struggle financially. The good news is that this is completely unnecessary. With the right coach you can make enough money to live a great lifestyle, get out of debt and prepare for retirement.
