      <h1>Seminar Attendee Testimonies</h1>

      <p>Best chiropractic seminar I have ever attended. I have been to others and even though the information was good, it didn't fit. This fits!
      <br><b>Mike Lyman DC</b></p>

      <p>I have been to lots of seminars.  During the classes I pray that the door is shut so that people don't hear what we are being taught. Worst of all... I hope a patient doesn't wander in. This seminar is one I wish we could have the door wide open so all could hear. This seminar is one I wish I could invite my patients to attend so that they can know the truth about how well they are being treated.

      <p>Doctor Naccarato takes a unique approach on the psychology of practice building. He has helped me to achieve better balance in my life and practice. He restores ethics to chiropractic practice building. His presentation is based on moral principles that raise the respect of individual doctors and our profession.

      <p>I have thought about the recent seminar that I attended. I want to thank you for your time and preparation for the true principles you taught about human relations, serving others, and internal motivation. I believe you are a good man and have sincere intents and I appreciate seeing that kind of leadership in our profession. You are doing a good service to Chiropractic but even more importantly you are impacting the personal lives of individuals in a positive and divine way. Thanks for your influence on mine.

      <p>I have watched and coached Jim for years. The balance between his business and personal life allows him to teach by example, not just words. I know more than most the depth of his gift to love, inspire and guide others to achieve true success in their lives! To succeed in today's health care market, you must attend this seminar!
