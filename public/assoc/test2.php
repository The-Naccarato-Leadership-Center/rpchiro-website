            <h1>State Association Testimonials Continued</h1>

            <p>I have listened to many dynamic chiropractic consultants over my nineteen years of practice. I never hired any of them because I did not want a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; practice. Then Dr. Naccarato was mentioned to me. I attended his &quot;First Two Weeks of Care&quot; seminar, and I knew he was the coach for me. Coach Jim (as I refer to him) connected with my strong athletic background and used my strengths as assets in building an even steadier practice. His style of coaching is unique and refreshing! He consistently strives for, and in my opinion succeeds in, building doctors who maintain life balance, longevity of practice, and high moral and ethical conduct. His practice coaching style is no nonsense, no gimmicks, and no shortcuts. Doctors who hire Jim will learn the secrets to practice success, family success, and preservation of one's own self. If at all possible, give Coach Jim a call and set up a conversation with him. I'm sure you'll be impressed!

            <p>Dr. Naccarato spoke at out state association meeting February 2008. His presentation was filled with solid, time-tested, ethical principles that apply to all practices. If followed, these would no doubt help to increase the overall professionalism of the chiropractic community. No gimmicks - just good sense. I highly recommend him for your state association seminars/conferences.

            <p>I have been acquainted with Doctor Jim for the past fifteen years and found him to be a professional in every sense of the word. He has spoken several times for us at the UCPA seminars/conventions. His presentations are loaded with state of the art practice building data, skills, and technology. The material is presented in an easy to implement format. And, those who attend leave edified and energized with specific (practical) things to do in their practices on Monday morning.  His ethics and principle-centered presentation is spot on, and exactly what the profession needs. I highly recommend Dr. Jim for your state association seminars/conferences.
