      <h1>Presentation Objective</h1>

      <p>In a struggling practice, you can experience extreme amounts of stress and discouragement causing you to lose your love for chiropractic or even conclude that becoming a chiropractor was a mistake. Take heart, regardless of your current situation there is an endless amount of good to focus on. Chiropractic is a wonderful approach to healthcare that provides a never ending opportunity to serve. Our fees are reasonable, overhead controllable, profit high, stress minimal, and our working environment is outstanding. At the end of the day, this is a great business to be a part of with little to complain about and a lot to be grateful for!</p>
 
      <p><b>Truth: </b>If there is one thing that all successful people have in common, it is their ability to face and overcome challenges. With this understanding, adversity is not something simply to be endured, rather it is something to be accepted and embraced. In this presentation Dr. Naccarato will help you overcome your challenges by offering <i>real</i> solutions to <i>real</i> problems with no hype, no gimmicks, and no quick fixes.</p>

      <p><b>Bottom Line: </b>You are a doctor. That is your genius and that is what you have been trained to do. To succeed you must accept that you cannot do it all. You must look to others for input and have the humility to act on what applies to your situation. Building a practice that will care for patients and provide financial stability for your family is an exciting prospect. At this presentation, Dr. Naccarato will teach you the tried and true principles to embrace in order to succeed.</p>
