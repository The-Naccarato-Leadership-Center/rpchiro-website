            <h1>State Association Testimonials</h1>

            <p>Dr. Jim Naccarato presented &quot;The Psychology of Successful Practice Building&quot; to our Kansas doctors of chiropractic during our Spring Convention, 2008. Evaluation forms were overwhelmingly positive, including several statements of &quot;bring him back.&quot; Course rating criteria included class time use, intellectual stimulation, appropriateness of topics, clear presentation, and responsiveness to questions.   In several evaluations the only improvement that was suggested for a better convention in the future was to &quot;bring Dr. Naccarato back every time.&quot;

            <p>I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Naccarato over the past year and a half or so. He has spoken at our seminars and I also sought his advice on several occasions. I found him to have a profound understanding of the issues surrounding the current chiropractic practice and to be an effective and inspirational communicator at our events. I also found him to be a willing servant of the profession who is generous with his time and who is a strong advocate for state association membership and involvement. I highly recommend Dr. Naccarato for your state association seminars/conferences.

            <p>Practice Management left a bad taste in my mouth shortly after I started practice 20 years ago, and as an evidence-based doctor, I'm not interested in promises and hype; I want rational, practical, logical and ethical advice. On a whim, I stopped by a class Dr. Naccarato was giving for our state association, expecting to leave in a couple minutes. Instead, I ended up signing up. He has helped me focus on the important things-no fluff, no gimmicks, no hype. If we had a lot more advisers like Dr. Naccarato, this profession would have a lot fewer problems. I feel like I am back in charge of not just my practice again, but my life as well. Thanks, Dr. Jim!

            <p>I have been personally associated with Dr. Jim Naccarato for over 10 years.  I have found his seminar information to be among the best in the business. In a healthcare environment run amuck, his &quot;no compromise&quot; approach to running an honest and forthright practice is second to none.  Among the skills that he teaches doctors, is how to balance family, practice, and personal growth in a manner that allows joy to permeate every aspect of life. I wholeheartedly recommend him for your state association seminars/conferences.
