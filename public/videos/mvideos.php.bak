				<div class="testimonials">I have been working with Dr. Naccarato for over a year and he is unlike any coach I have ever had. His program and philosophies are solid, sound and grounded. They&rsquo;re tested and proven to work. He is a student of success and a teacher of the principles that lead there. His psychological approach is science, not speculation. Since working with Jim I have seen a significant and measureable increase, not only in my practice results, but in my focus and overall joy in what matters most in life.<br><b>--Robert Shire DC</b>
