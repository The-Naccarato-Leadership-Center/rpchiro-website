This program is not for everyone. It does not include fads, scripts, undignified marketing procedures, reduced fees, case fees, family discounts, or pre-pay agreements. These are poor attempts to incentivize patients into care and there will always be someone willing to offer a better deal. While they may work in the short term, they create huge practice building problems in the long run.  The good news is that in this program you will build your practice on value, creating a thriving environment for both you and your patients!
