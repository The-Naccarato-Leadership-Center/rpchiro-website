			<h1>Program Focus</h1>

			<p>Dr. Naccarato's program teaches you how to succeed and prosper by understanding that people make up the foundation of every successful practice. The following pyramid illustrates how the human element impacts the other aspects of every practice:</p>

			<div><img src="../images/Pyramid.png" style="float: left; max-width: 40%;">
				<p><b>Goals-</b> The numbers you are committed to achieve.</p>
				<p><b>Actions-</b> What you and your staff do or the procedures you follow to achieve your goals.</p>
				<p><b>People-</b> You, your staff, and your patients.</p>
				<p>The chart flows upward. To achieve your goals, focus on people first, you and your staff's actions second, and your goals third.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Many doctors believe that to build a successful practice, all they need to do is focus on procedures. Not true. There are many excellent doctors who do everything by the book and yet remain on the verge of bankruptcy. To succeed and prosper you must master the human element. Everything flows up from there!</p>
