			<p>With my emphasis on personal coaching, you may be asking yourself why the option of a self-coaching program?  The truth is I can only handle so many doctors on my personal coaching program. However, I don't want you, your practice, or your family to suffer. The self-coaching program is so good, complete, and easy to implement that I am confident your practice will grow and improve significantly. The results of this program are success, prosperity, and a practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; font-style: italic;">My experience has taught me that the only way to solve the problems chiropractors face is to understand and implement the integrity based, time-proven principles and procedures of success and prosperity taught in my personal and self-coaching programs.</p>

			<p><b>So, here is my commitment to you;</b> the self-coaching program will teach you how to build a low-stress, low overhead, high profit practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer. By using dignified and integrity-based procedures, you will become a powerfully confident doctor capable of creating lasting success and prosperity while keeping your life in balance.</p>
