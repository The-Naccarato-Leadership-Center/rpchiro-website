	<h1>Why My Weekly Email Coaching Program?</h1>
    <div class="text">Many doctors ask for practice-building advice; however, when they receive advice that requires effort, seems hard to implement, goes against their wishes, or  is advice they would rather not act on, they resist the advice by rationalizing with reasons which are simply excuses to not do what they know they need to do. It is at this point that they become grid-locked in their all too common, albeit wanting, situation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Truth:</b> Many doctors recognize the need to make  changes in order to improve their situation. But if recognizing the need to make changes were enough, they would have already made the changes!  Furthermore, many doctors recongize the need to make changes and take the next step by asking for practice-building advice. However, what they all to commonly want is someone to agree with their current way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. In other words, they want someone to help them be better at what they are currently doing even though it is obvious that it isn't working. Bad form!
<br>
<br>
<b>Bottom line:</b> The changes that need to be made in order to succeed and prosper (with or without health insurance) while keeping your life in balance must be made now, precisely when the pressure is on, time is at a premium, and money is (frequently) tight. What you need is commitment, confidence, open-mindedness, self-discipline, and a personal coach. The good news: Some people welcome the help, sign up for a coaching program, give it their all, experience the benefits, and are thankful for the help. The not so good news: Other people are as eager to be coached as they are to cut their salaries.
<br>
<br>
