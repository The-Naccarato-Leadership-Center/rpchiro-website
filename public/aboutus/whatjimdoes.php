      <h1>What Dr. Jim Does</h1>

      <h2>His Professional Purpose:</h2>

      <p>If you were to analyze Dr. Naccarato's professional DNA, you would find the following: He is here to teach doctors to succeed and prosper so they can get on with the other important things in life, such as God, family, and friends. Examine how he lives his life and you will see that he is unconditionally committed to achieving this objective. His purpose is more than just a series of goals, it is a part of who he is and everything he does. It is that important to him. This work is not only what he does, it is who he is. It is what he feels he was born to do.</p>

      <h2>His Coaching Program:</h2>

      <p>In Dr. Jim's personal coaching program, he will help you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identify and resolve the root issues that are holding you back</li>
        <li>Identify and capitalize on your strengths so you can move forward</li>
        <li>Solve your practice building problems</li>
        <li>Create professional success and prosperity while maintaining a balanced and deeply rewarding personal life</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>His Coaching Philosophy:</h2>

      <p>Throughout Dr. Naccarato's career, he has learned to love challenges. Although it initially seems easier to achieve goals with little opposition, he has found that he grows so much more while overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges. It is during these times that he finds himself on his knees looking up to God to draw strength and clarify his resolve, intent, and commitment.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Resolve -</b> what has he really made up his mind to do?</li>
        <li><b>Intent -</b> why is he really doing what he is doing?</li>
        <li><b>Commitment -</b> what is he really willing to do?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dr. Jim has helped others go through this process so that they no longer fear opposition. His goal is to help doctors see these inevitable challenges as defining moments and opportunities they need to become the best that they can be.</p>
