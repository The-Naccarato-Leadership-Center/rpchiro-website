      <h1>About Dr. Naccarato</h1>

      <p>Dr. Naccarato's passion is to help doctors build successful practices so they can focus on the other important things in life, such as God, family, and friends. His focus is to help build practices and lives filled with integrity. This philosophy is evident in the information he teaches, the procedures he encourages, and the manner in which he coaches his doctors.</p>

      <p>Dr. Naccarato has a DC degree and a PhD in psychology, is a continuing studies student at Stanford University, and has been a personal business coach for 29 years. As such, he has the experience to help doctors not only make a difference in their practices, but also in their families, relationships, and the world around them. His focus is to help doctors build successful practices while maintaining a balanced life. By working on virtues such as self-control, courage, compassion, hard work, and integrity his program enhances what doctors know, what they do, and ultimately who they are.</p>

      <h2>The Importance of Success and Prosperity</h2>

      <p>Many believe material possessions are superficial because they have never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul. They feel that focusing on making money is not a noble, honorable, or moral endeavor. True for the dead, not true for the living.</p>

      <p>Dr. Naccarato has proven that everything in life is either positively or negatively impacted by your success. If you build your practice correctly then you are free to focus on other important things in life. If you build your practice incorrectly then it will become a chain around your neck squeezing the very life out of you. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week.</p>

      <p>To build a successful practice you must <b>say</b> the right things, <b>do</b> the right things, and <b>be</b> the right person. To find out how Dr. Naccarato can help you achieve these critical objectives, call and setup an appointment to speak with him personally! <a href="../contactus/contactus.php">Click here</a> for our contact information.</p>
