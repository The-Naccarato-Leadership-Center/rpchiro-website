        <h2>Coaching Testimonies</h2>

          <p>Dr. Jim Naccarato's personal coaching program is something that I recommend to all my friends because it has changed my life. Dr. Naccarato will help you value your time and charge what you are really worth. Not only that, he'll help you run a principle-centered, honest practice which will improve your life. Dr. Naccarato does more than just talk about chiropractic. He helps you get your head straight so that you can deal with your practice, your patients, and your entire life from a more balanced and truthful place.
          <br><strong>Chris Tucker DC</strong></p>

          <p>I have been in practice for over 30 years and have been working with Dr. Naccarato for the past several. He focuses on helping the doctor become the type of person that people listen to and trust. He has an honest, ethical, and straight-forward approach to practice-building. No gimmicks, no bait and switch, no trying to convince patients to buy something they don't want or need. Learn how to become the kind of doctor that people, including yourself, can respect.
          <br><strong>Mark Stokes DC</strong></p>

          <p>I have been in practice for over 12 years and even though I never had too many problems in building a practice, I was never able to maintain balance. Dr. Naccarato has helped me greatly with both business and personal development. I would highly recommend him as a personal coach to any doctor looking to improve success in his life.
          <br><strong>Timothy J. Klena DC, DABCO </strong></p>

          <p>Doctor Naccarato takes a unique approach on the psychology of practice building. He has helped me to achieve better balance in my life and practice. He restores ethical chiropractic practice building that is based on moral principles that raise the respect of individual doctors and our profession.
          <br><strong>Corey Matthews DC</strong></p>

          <p>I have been in health care services for over 30 years. Doctor Naccarato tunes out the marketing babble and brings back the basic principles of service and balance. The Principle-Centered Personal Coaching program is the first program I have attended which gave me the enthusiasm needed, and the knowledge of how to practice my profession ethically and honorably. There are no gimmicks in this program.
          <br><strong>Roland Morrison DC</strong></p>

          <p>Dr. Jim Naccarato is an answer to prayer. He really listens to and goes to the heart of the issue. He tells the truth in a way that has helped me change for the better. My practice has both simplified and grown because of his coaching. I recommend Dr. Jim with all my heart. He will help you make your dreams come true.
          <br><strong>Venus  Maher DC</strong></p>

          <p>Dr. Naccarato has been my coach for almost a decade. He has helped me build a strong, stable, anxiety-free practice. I am most impressed with his impeccable integrity. He will be my coach for as long as I remain in practice.
          <br><strong>Brian Jenkins DC, BCAO </strong></p>

          <p>Dr. Jim is a man of integrity who has helped me to examine myself and become a better person, which in turn, has helped me become a better doctor. Jim helps me to "think outside the box," to step back and evaluate how things are and where I am headed. He has helped me to achieve a better balance in my life which will strengthen the most important organization in my life, my family.
          <br><strong>Brad R. Egbert, DC</strong></p>

          <p>I know that Dr. Naccarato works with approximately 75 practice's a week. I can personally attest that my collections and services have increased over 10k a month in  the three years that I have worked with him. It's not so much what he has told me to do in processing patients. It has more to do with the psychology of preparing myself for taking care of patients. He provides a unique approach based on his background as a PHD in psychology and his DC degree. He is able to draw on experiences with other health care professionals that he manages in taking a personalized approach to each of his clients. He has helped me to understand that balance in my life equates to greater and sustainable long term growth. He does not offer a quick fix approach, instead he offers you the opportunity at a great life. 
          <br><strong>Phil Dieter, DC</strong></p>

          <p>When we can rely on the thoroughness and principle of the procedures we use to educate patients, they get the depth of dedication and purpose we convey enhancing their trust and belief in what we are giving them.  I have never felt so settled in practice, and am thoroughly happy with my staff and our mutual understanding of how to attract and serve those who feel compelled to pay, stay, and refer.  That is practice building in its most complete form.

        <h2>Seminar Testimonies</h2>

        <p>Dr. Jim's seminar is loaded with state of the art practice building data, skills, and technology. The material is presented in an easy to implement format. I highly recommend Dr. Jim's seminar for the new as well as the established practitioner desiring to build a low overhead practice full of patients who stay, pay, and refer. 
        <br><strong>Lew Wheelwright, DC</strong></p>

        <p>I have been to lots of practice management seminars. During the classes I pray that the door is shut so that people don't hear what we are being taught. Worst of all... I hope a patient doesn't wander in. This seminar is one I wish we could have the door wide open so all could hear. This seminar is one I wish I could invite my patients to attend so that they can know the truth about how well they are being treated.
        <br><strong>Freeman Brackett, DC</strong></p>

        <p>I found Dr Naccarato to be informative and practical. The strategies and advice he gave were very useful. His style of presentation was entertaining yet very focused to the issues at hand. I would highly recommend that if you have a chance to hear Dr. Naccarato--Do It.
        <br><strong>Dr. David Benevento, CFO California Chiropractic Association</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Dr. Naccarato, I and my staff very much appreciated your speaking at our seminar. Not only were you bright, articulate and focused, your no-nonsense approach appealed greatly to my staff and myself. Your themes were concrete and fact-heavy. Your message of changing the doctor to change the practice makes practical and pragmatic sense. I look forward to further insights and inspiration from you both personally and for the CCA. 
        <br><strong>Maia James, DC - Secretary, California Chiropractic Association</strong></p>

        <p>Great seminar! Very interesting, fast-paced, exciting, and informative. I can implement the information immediately. Thank you! 
        <br><strong>Donna Yerman, DC</strong></p>

        <p>Best chiropractic seminar I have ever attended. I have been to others and even though the information was good, it didn't fit. This fits! 
        <br><strong>Duane Eyre, DC</strong></p>

        <p>I have watched and coached Jim for years. The balance between his business and personal life allows him to teach by example, not just words. I know more than most the depth of his gift to love, inspire and guide others to achieve true success in their lives! To succeed in today's health care market, you must attend this seminar!
        <br><strong>Leo Weidner, Author of "Achieving The Balance"</strong></p>

        <p>I have been with Dr. Naccarato for nine years. This seminar is exceptionally good. Several ideas presented will be applied to my practice this week. Your work assists me to stay in the top 20%. 
        <br><strong>Jeff States, DC</strong></p>

        <p>After being a C.A. for 8 years and attending many practice-building seminars, it is a pleasure to attend a seminar that makes so much sense, is so simple, and rings true. Great Job!! 
        <br><strong>Fara Swanson, C.A.</strong></p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato teaches true principles about human relations, serving others, and internal motivation. I appreciate seeing that kind of leadership in our profession. He is doing a good service to chiropractic but even more importantly he is impacting the personal lives of individuals in a positive and divine way. Thanks for your influence on mine. 
        <br><strong>David Price, DC</strong></p>

        <p>I have been to many management seminars and have been taught that to succeed in practice I need to do procedures I don't feel comfortable doing. With this approach I know I can get an A+. I can do it all.
