        <h3>Who is Dr. Naccarato?</h3>
        <p>Dr. Naccarato's passion is to help doctors build successful practices so they can focus on the other important things in life, such as God, family, and friends. His focus is to help build practices and lives filled with integrity. This philosophy is evident in the information he teaches, the procedures he encourages, and the manner in which he coaches his doctors.
        </p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has a DC degree and a PhD in psychology, is a continuing studies student at Stanford University, and has been a personal business coach for 28 years. As such, he has the experience to help doctors not only make a difference in their practices, but also in their families, relationships, and the world around them. His focus is to help doctors build successful practices while maintaining a balanced life. By working on virtues such as self-control, courage, compassion, hard work, and integrity his program enhances what doctors know, what they do, and ultimately who they are.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has been helping doctors build successful practices since 1991 and was named one of the top five management coaches by the California Chiropractor's Association. He has accumulated over 28 years and 56,000 hours of personal coaching experience. He has spoken for the Chiropractic Associations of California, Utah, Idaho, Iowa, Texas, New Jersey, and Kansas. He has also spoken at the CCA's Best of Management seminars and has his own seminar series which includes The First Two Weeks of Care, Internal Marketing, and External Marketing.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato is the founder of The Realigned Practice, the Personal Coaching Program, and the Weekly Email-Coaching Program. He is the developer of The Inner-Circle Approach to Practice Building and has authored several books, including: Principle-Centered Practice Building, The Psychology of Succeeding in Practice: What Every Doctor Must Know, and The Key Indicators of Success and Prosperity for Chiropractors.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato owned Naccarato Chiropractic in San Luis Obispo, California and was co-owner and manager of a multi-doctor chiropractic clinic. Before becoming a chiropractor and personal success coach, he was a marketing representative for Weidner Communications, a member of Success Technologies, and a contributing author of Achieving the Balance by Leo Weidner.</p>
          
        <p>Dr. Jim Naccarato has a Bachelor of Science and a PhD in Psychology, and is also a licensed Doctor of Chiropractic.</p>

        <h3>The Importance of Success and Prosperity</h3>

        <p>Many believe material possessions are superficial because they have never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul. They feel that focusing on making money is not a noble, honorable, or moral endeavor. True for the dead, not true for the living.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has proven that everything in life is either positively or negatively impacted by your success. If you build your practice correctly then you are free to focus on other important things in life. If you build your practice incorrectly then it will become a chain around your neck squeezing the very life out of you. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week.</p>

        <p>To build a successful practice you must say the right things, do the right things, and be the right person. To find out how Dr. Naccarato can help you achieve these critical objectives, call and setup an appointment to speak with him personally!</p>
