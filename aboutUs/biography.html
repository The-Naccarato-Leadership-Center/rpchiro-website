        <h3>Who is Dr. Naccarato?</h3>
        <p>Dr. Naccarato's passion is to help doctors build successful practices so they can focus on the other important things in life, such as God, family, and friends. His focus is to help build practices and lives filled with integrity. This philosophy is evident in the information he teaches, the procedures he encourages, and the manner in which he coaches his doctors.
        </p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has a DC degree and a PhD in psychology, is a continuing studies student at Stanford University, and has been a personal business coach for 28 years. As such, he has the experience to help doctors not only make a difference in their practices, but also in their families, relationships, and the world around them. His focus is to help doctors build successful practices while maintaining a balanced life. By working on virtues such as self-control, courage, compassion, hard work, and integrity his program enhances what doctors know, what they do, and ultimately who they are.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has been helping doctors build successful practices since 1991 and was named one of the top five management coaches by the California Chiropractor's Association. He has accumulated over 28 years and 56,000 hours of personal coaching experience. He has spoken for the Chiropractic Associations of California, Utah, Idaho, Iowa, Texas, New Jersey, and Kansas. He has also spoken at the CCA's Best of Management seminars and has his own seminar series which includes The First Two Weeks of Care, Internal Marketing, and External Marketing.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato is the founder of The Realigned Practice, the Personal Coaching Program, and the Weekly Email-Coaching Program. He is the developer of The Inner-Circle Approach to Practice Building and has authored several books, including: Principle-Centered Practice Building, The Psychology of Succeeding in Practice: What Every Doctor Must Know, and The Key Indicators of Success and Prosperity for Chiropractors.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato owned Naccarato Chiropractic in San Luis Obispo, California and was co-owner and manager of a multi-doctor chiropractic clinic. Before becoming a chiropractor and personal success coach, he was a marketing representative for Weidner Communications, a member of Success Technologies, and a contributing author of Achieving the Balance by Leo Weidner.</p>
          
        <p>Dr. Jim Naccarato has a Bachelor of Science and a PhD in Psychology, and is also a licensed Doctor of Chiropractic.</p>

        <h3>The Importance of Success and Prosperity</h3>

        <p>Many believe material possessions are superficial because they have never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul. They feel that focusing on making money is not a noble, honorable, or moral endeavor. True for the dead, not true for the living.</p>

        <p>Dr. Naccarato has proven that everything in life is either positively or negatively impacted by your success. If you build your practice correctly then you are free to focus on other important things in life. If you build your practice incorrectly then it will become a chain around your neck squeezing the very life out of you. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week.</p>

        <p>To build a successful practice you must say the right things, do the right things, and be the right person. To find out how Dr. Naccarato can help you achieve these critical objectives, call and setup an appointment to speak with him personally!</p>

        <h2>His Professional Purpose:</h2>

        <p>If you were to analyze Dr. Naccarato's professional DNA, you would find the following: He is here to teach doctors to succeed and prosper so they can get on with the other important things in life, such as God, family, and friends. Examine how he lives his life and you will see that he is unconditionally committed to achieving this objective. His purpose is more than just a series of goals, it is a part of who he is and everything he does. It is that important to him. This work is not only what he does, it is who he is. It is what he feels he was born to do.</p>

        <h2>His Coaching Program:</h2>

        <p>In Dr. Jim's personal coaching program, he will help you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identify and resolve the root issues that are holding you back</li>
          <li>Identify and capitalize on your strengths so you can move forward</li>
          <li>Solve your practice building problems</li>
          <li>Create professional success and prosperity while maintaining a balanced and deeply rewarding personal life</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>His Coaching Philosophy:</h2>
        <p>Throughout Dr. Naccarato's career, he has learned to love challenges. Although it initially seems easier to achieve goals with little opposition, he has found that he grows so much more while overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges. It is during these times that he finds himself on his knees looking up to God to draw strength and clarify his resolve, intent, and commitment.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Resolve -</strong> What has he really made up his mind to do?</li>
          <li><strong>Intent -</strong> Why is he really doing what he is doing?</li>
          <li><strong>Commitment -</strong>What is he really willing to do?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dr. Jim has helped others go through this process so that they no longer fear opposition. His goal is to help doctors see these inevitable challenges as defining moments and opportunities they need to become the best that they can be.</p>
